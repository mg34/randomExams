# randomExams
a miniproject to select a random form and take it to the client side.

The workflow of this project is:

You paste the url of your web app in classroom or somewhere else, when the user click's on the generate my exam button,
it generates a random number between 1 and the number or forms in the sheet. It takes the url form and insert a hyperlink in the page.
When a user opens the link it takes him to the form and close the window of the app.
It adds a record to the sheet to track when and who took the exam.

Hope it serves.
